Hi Team,we opened a case with F-Secure vendor team (05060772) they find out RCA is some F-Secure services not properly uninstalled. so they provided one file to uninstall all F-Secure services. Now we uninstalled & rebooted and reinstalled the F-Secure on that affected server (S101A242). The F-Secure services are running up & fine. Hence, we are closing this incident.
F-Secure AVIR and Tehtris are both now re-installed sucessfully & stable

PHASE : FINAL ANALYSIS
=> DIAGNOSIS :
On 2023-04-23 03:13:36 UTC, the incident was triggered because the user ADM_2400112Y has generated the event Failure Audit: An attempt was made to reset an account's password (event code : 4724) on the host S260T01A.roquette.corp.priv.
Regarding the LDAP information, the user involved is 'null' with the email CONGQIANG.ADM_WANG@roquette.com from the department 'null'.
=> RECOMMENDATIONS : Investigate the behavior of the account
=> NEXT ACTION : Waiting for customer feedback about the impact, the detection quality, the investigation quality, any improvement proposal.

Monitored the new alerts for some time, also checked the graphs of utilization of availability manager internal processes to see if there is any spike in the data.7. We have observed that the queue size is having high count due to transaction/long running queries issues. This is already being checked over the database side.
