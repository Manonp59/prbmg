Hi Team,we opened a case with F-Secure vendor team (05060772) they find out RCA is some F-Secure services not properly uninstalled. so they provided one file to uninstall all F-Secure services. Now we uninstalled & rebooted and reinstalled the F-Secure on that affected server (S101A242). The F-Secure services are running up & fine. Hence, we are closing this incident.
F-Secure AVIR and Tehtris are both now re-installed sucessfully & stable

Monitored the new alerts for some time, also checked the graphs of utilization of availability manager internal processes to see if there is any spike in the data.7. We have observed that the queue size is having high count due to transaction/long running queries issues. This is already being checked over the database side.
